<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>The first fast growing trees like
the flowering ash planted by the Association ten years ago , are now over
2 meters tall.&nbsp; Some have got to more than 3 meters – like the one
on the photo.</font></font>

They produce seeds which when disseminated by the wind engender fresh seedlings
producing what will then spread into a&nbsp; whole forest in a&nbsp; perfectly
natural way.</font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Precise statistics on the success
rate of planting were drawn up by a student who used the findings in his
agricultural thesis at the University of Provence. He worked on a representative
site reforested by the association ten years ago.&nbsp; A full count of
the existing or missing trees was made along with other parameters , followed
by a concluding synthesis.</font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>The count carried out in Spring
2001 concerned 2719 plots out of which 2509 are now occupied by a living
tree.&nbsp; <font color="#3366FF">The success rate after ten years is therefore
91.6%&nbsp; which indisputably proves the validity of the planting methods
used and the choice of species.</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Indeed, this particular reforestation
comprises 70% ash, 20% oak and 10% true service trees.</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>The initial number of each
species planted is unknown so it is impossible to calculate the actual
success rate per species. What can be said, however, is that <u>the minimal
success rate</u> is 87% for ash, 67% for oak and 53% for the service trees.&nbsp;
The success rate for the oaks which will become the dominant tree of future
forests is, in itself, already very satisfactory.</font></font>
