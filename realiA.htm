<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>One of the goals of the ARPCV
is to present to a wide public the importance and&nbsp; beauty of Sainte-Victoire.
For that purpose, the association has written and&nbsp; edited two very
complete documents on the mountain. (only available&nbsp; in French).</font></font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#FF0000">Sorry,
all these books are not available any more..</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>* </font><font color="#009900"><font size=+2>Book
:&nbsp; &laquo; Sainte Victoire, discovery of a footpath &raquo;</font></font></font>
<p><img SRC="sentier1.jpg" BORDER=0 height=80 width=120 align=LEFT><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;
This book deals with the different topics raised by discoveries made on
the discovery footpath created by the association. Subjects such as botany,
geology and archaeology, dinosaurs and present day animals, history of
people and traditions are developed. Beautiful pictures illustrate the
texts, and a map helps the visitor on his walk.</font></font>

Rom on Sainte Victoire :</font></font></font>
<p><img SRC="cdcouv.gif" height=86 width=99 align=LEFT><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;
The CD-Rom presentation of the mountain offers two aspects :</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>-&nbsp; A sort of game in
which for the different subjects encountered you must reconstitute all
the operations needed to bring them to conclusion.&nbsp; The subjects related
to the mountain are for instance, bringing dinosaur’s eggs to Aix museum,
making wine, making a picture like Cezanne…</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>- A very precious source of
information about Sainte Victoire, in which 160 subjects are developed,
and illustrated by around 1000 pictures.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>This CD-rom was awarded a special
prize in 1999 by the regional council, as the best publication related
to environmental education.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>* In the environmental domain,
the association has also edited the first “</font><font color="#666600"><font size=+2>regional
guide to the courses dedicated to&nbsp; the environment</font></font><font size=+1>.”</font></font>
<p><img SRC="guide_red.jpg" height=119 width=85 align=LEFT><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>
 This is the first directory which contains all the courses (232) dedicated
to the&nbsp; environment in Provence , the&nbsp; Alps, and the&nbsp; C&ocirc;te
d’Azur region. For each topic, the required standard of entry, the type
and duration of courses, as well as the jobs that can be found at the end,
are described.</font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#666600"><font size=+2>Creation
of a Mediterranean arboretum near Sainte Victoire :</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>The main new project of the
association is to create an arboretum dedicated to Mediterranean trees
and vegetation at the foot of Sainte Victoire.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>An arboretum is a park dedicated
to&nbsp; the&nbsp; protection, development and conservation of tree species.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>It would&nbsp; then have:</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>- An educational role :&nbsp;
helping people to identify familiar or rare trees.</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>- A scientific role : studies
of species, attempts to acclimatise foreign species.</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>- A role of conservation (certain
species are threatened to disappear)</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>The association would like
such a site to be open to the public at large , so that it could become
a tourist attraction for people visiting Sainte Victoire as well as for
local people. Many jobs could be created around this project, such as&nbsp;
a visitor’s&nbsp; centre, tourist guides, maintenance of the site …</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>For this purpose, the&nbsp;
ARPCV plans to buy a 5 to 20 hectares ground close to the mountain. Since
its creation, the association has been saving money in order to develop
this project. Nevertheless, such a project cannot succeed without financial
support from public organisations as well as from private sponsors.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>If you are interested in participating
in such a dynamic project, or only wish to discuss&nbsp; it, please contact
the association.</font></font>
