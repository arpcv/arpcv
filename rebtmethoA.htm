<p><b><font color="#000000">Extracts from an article written by Michel
Thinon, research scientist at the C.N.R.S.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">(National Center for Scientific Research)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>* The
methods of reforestation used since 1987 by the A.R.P.C.V. after severe
fire ravaged the Montagne Sainte Victoire, differ from those usually employed
which take as a basic principle that the Mediterranean forest is, by nature,
made up of holly oak and pines.&nbsp; Hence, despite its success, the A.R.P.C.V.
has been open to question, criticism, and at times, frank hostility.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#000000">* </font><font color="#FF0000">The
Association’s conception of forestation reposes on scientific observation
which includes the dimensions of history</font><font color="#000000">.&nbsp;
The varying disciplines dealing with the study of plants provide undeniable
proof that the Mediterranean vegetation as we know it nowadays is not natural.&nbsp;
It is nothing but the way Nature has found to adapt itself to the constant
aggressions of Man over the past 6000 years.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#000000">* </font><font color="#FF0000">In
fact, originally, Mediterranean vegetation was dominated by&nbsp; deciduous
oaks like the downy oak</font><font color="#000000">.&nbsp; From 5000 BC
onwards, Man adopted a new lifestyle in that he started to produce his
own food -&nbsp; this was the “Neolithic revolution”.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire
was constantly&nbsp; used for the clearing and upkeep of pastureland and
cultivated areas.&nbsp; Around 2000 BC, at a period of stable climate,
forests had practically disappeared&nbsp; - the scrubland familiar to us
all had become the norm.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>* The
Mediterranean landscape as we know it nowadays appears therefore to be
the result of a man-made syndrome : fire – pastureland.&nbsp; The vegetation
that best stands up to such treatment was gradually selected over thousands
of years and it now makes up for the major part of what is called natural
land and its particular sensitivity to fire can be traced right back to
this.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>* In
order to put an end to this logic of planting what will fuel tomorrow’s
fires, the (re)creation of less sensitive woodland should be envisaged
and were there fresh outbreaks of fire , investments in planting would
then be unnecessary.&nbsp; Only rational forestation which integrates ecological
imperatives will achieve this double objective.</font></font></font>
