<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>* The sites reforested by the
Association are sites <font color="#FF0000">belonging to the public sector</font>&nbsp;
i.e. ones to which the public have free access.</font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>* The first reforestation programmes
were carried out on the Cengle, a chalky plateau on the southern side of
the Montagne Sainte-Victoire.</font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>* A loan of land from the locality
of Puyloubier on the south eastern side of the mountain has permitted for
the <font color="#3366FF">creation of a botanical garden</font> containing
the different types of trees and plants found in the region.&nbsp; Visitors,
particularly groups, can go round the footpath which signposts the varying
species.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>* For several years now, reforestation
has been effected on ground belonging to the Foreign Legion at Puyloubier
which is state-owned.&nbsp; We would like to express our gratitude to the
management of this institution for its support and we appreciate the loan
of tractors and tools as well as use of its grounds for a reception at
the end of each annual replanting.</font></font>
